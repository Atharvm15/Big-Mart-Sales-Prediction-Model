- **R-Squared Value (Training):** The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model to the training data. R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the training data.

- **Prediction on Test Data:** Next, the trained model is applied to the test data (X_test) to make predictions on unseen data samples. This step evaluates the generalization ability of the model and its performance on data it has not been trained on.

- **R-Squared Value (Test):** Similar to the training data, the R-squared value is calculated for the predictions made on the test data. This metric quantifies the predictive performance of the model on new, unseen data. A high R-squared value on the test data indicates that the model's predictions closely match the actual sales values, signifying good generalization ability.
